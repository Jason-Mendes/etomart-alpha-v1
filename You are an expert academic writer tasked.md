Abstract
Despite Windhoek’s economic growth, significant disparities in access to essential goods
persist, particularly in the city’s underserved northern areas and informal settlements. This
study explores the feasibility of implementing Etomart, an e-commerce platform designed to
bridge this accessibility gap by leveraging technology to provide equitable access to essential
goods and services. Recognizing the challenges faced by African e-commerce venturessuch as
logistical constraints, limited payment gateways, security concerns, customer trust deficits,
high data costs, and competition from traditional retailersthe research assesses whether
Etomart can serve as a viable solution within Windhoek’s unique socio-economic context.
A comprehensive market analysis is conducted, evaluating technological readiness and
digital literacy levels, and analyzing socio-economic and infrastructural factors that may
impact the implementation and adoption of Etomart. The study also examines potential
economic and social impacts on local businesses and marginalized communities, proposing
strategies to ensure the platform’s long-term sustainability and scalability in the Namibian
context. These findings serve as the foundation for developing a Minimum Viable Product
(MVP) tailored to the specific needs of Windhoek residents.
The significance of this study lies in its commitment to fostering a more equitable Windhoek by addressing the persistent accessibility gap for essential goods bridging the divide
between technology and social equity, Etomart aims to alleviate daily hardships faced by
disadvantaged populations, reduce inequality, and improve the overall quality of life. The
findings provide actionable insights and evidence-based recommendations for policymakers, business leaders, and community organizations, potentially shaping future initiatives to
enhance access to essential goods in Windhoek and similar urban environments.
1 INTRODUCTION
In an age defined by instant access to knowledge, services, and resources, where technology
has redefined how we meet our needs, it is striking that many residents of Windhoek still face
significant challenges in accessing essential goods. This reality highlights a critical gap that
calls for innovative solutions.
Bridging the Accessibility Gap of Essential Goods in Windhoek is a feasibility study centered
on Etomart, an innovative delivery platform designed to tackle the diverse challenges surrounding access to essential goods and services in Namibia’s capital, affecting various communities
and residents. Windhoek grapples with significant socio-economic disparities, as evidenced by
Namibia’s projected Gini coefficient of 0.58 for 2024, indicating a high level of income inequality (Statista, 2024), particularly as the population is projected to more than double by 2050,
4
Namibia University of Science and Technology
leading to heightened demands for essentials (e.g., water, goods, services and other essential
needs) of which are set to intensify .
This demographic shift, which is already significantly impacting Windhoek’s resource demands,
underscores the urgent need for innovative solutions as seen in Murray et al. (2018) and as the
capital city experiences rapid urbanization and economic growth, it faces significant challenges
in its supply chain, particularly in underserved informal settlements where residents struggle to
access basic necessities like food, household items and other basic needs due to socio-economic
disparities. This geographical split contribute to the ingrained disparities in the basic living
conditions and opportunities.
Windhoek’s layout tells a glaring story of this socioeconomic divide. The non-northern parts of
Windhoek’s areas stand in sharp contrast to its northern sector. This geographical split isn’t
just about location; it represents a deep-rooted disparity in living conditions and opportunities.
While residents in the central and surrounding areas enjoy better access to services and amenities, those in the northern areas often face significant challenges in their daily lives. This divide
shows a clear separation, highlighting the uneven distribution of resources and development
across the city. The contrast between these areas serves as a constant reminder of the economic
inequalities that persist in Windhoek, therefore, underscoring the need for solutions that can
bridge this gap and foster inclusive growth.
1.1 Background
Windhoek’s socio-economic landscape is a mix of historical inequalities and modern challenges.
Presenting the city’s dual economy, a legacy of systemic exclusion prior to 1990, presented as
a modern, highly developed sector coexisting with an informal, subsistence-oriented one (The
World Bank, 2024). This contrast underpins three primary socio-economic challenges:
• Significant disparities in income and living standards persist across different demographic
groups.
• Ongoing poverty is compounded by limited access to essential goods and services.
• High unemployment rates, especially among youth, due to slow job creation and low
productivity in primary sectors.
These challenges are especially pronounced in Windhoek’s northern areas, where the concentration of supermarkets is disproportionately low. The uneven distribution of retail outlets,
combined with inadequate transportation infrastructure, creates significant obstacles for residents seeking access to essential goods. (Münch, 2023) (Nickanor et al., 2019).
While e-commerce has revolutionized consumer access globally, Namibia’s market, particularly
in the food and grocery sector, is yet to fully harness this digital transformation. This gap
presents an opportunity to explore how e-commerce platforms could address the specific needs
of Windhoek’s socio-economically disadvantaged communities, including the elderly, the unemployed, and marginalized groups. However, it’s important to recognize that the uptake of
technologies like online shopping in Africa has been slower compared to other regions due to
factors such as affordability and literacy levels (TEUTEBERG, 2020). Despite these challenges, there are significant opportunities for growth in mobile money and e-commerce, as these
technologies can leapfrog traditional barriers and provide accessible solutions to underserved
populations (TEUTEBERG, 2020).
By understanding and adapting to the unique context of Windhoek, this study focuses on
evaluating the feasibility and potential impact of implementing an e-commerce platform as
there is potential to leverage e-commerce solutions to bridge the accessibility gap for essential
goods. Potential benefits include overcoming transportation barriers, expanding access to a
5

wider range of goods, and stimulating local economic activity through partnerships with smallscale retailers and producers.
A comprehensive understanding of the socio-economic context and the specific barriers to accessing essential goods in Windhoek is crucial for assessing the potential of e-commerce solutions
like Etomart. This research aims to contribute to this understanding and provide evidencebased recommendations for leveraging technology to improve the quality of life for Windhoek
residents.
2 LITERATURE REVIEW
Access to essential goods in Windhoek’s communities is severely limited by a combination of
socio-economic disparities and infrastructural challenges. Recent reports highlight that rapid
urbanization in the northern informal settlements has contributed to issues such as high unemployment, illegal land occupation, and the proliferation of informal housing. These factors,
along with a scarcity of retail outlets and unreliable transportation, not only hinder daily living
but also deepen existing inequalities(Wijesinghe & Thorn, 2021) (Shinyemba, 2019).
In other African cities, e-commerce platforms have begun to address similar challenges by offering delivery services that bypass traditional infrastructural limitations . For instance, in
Nairobi, the introduction of mobile-based ordering systems has improved access to groceries for
low-income residents, better accessibility for restaurants to address issues like long queues and
complicated online ordering systems. These examples suggest that a tailored e-commerce solution like Etomart could potentially alleviate some of the accessibility issues faced by Windhoek’s
disadvantaged populations (Munene & Kasamani, 2018).
The intersection of e-commerce, urban accessibility, and socio-economic development in African
cities presents a complex and understudied area of research. While extensive literature exists
on e-commerce adoption in other developing and developed countries, there is a notable scarcity
of studies specifically addressing Namibia’s unique urban context. This literature review aims
to synthesize relevant research from comparable African and developing contexts, applying
these insights to Windhoek’s specific challenges. By examining broader themes of e-commerce
in developing countries, urban accessibility issues, and innovative delivery models, we seek
to establish a fundamental concept for the feasibility of delivery platforms like Etomart in
Windhoek. This will highlight the significant gaps in Namibia-specific research, underscoring
the potential contributions of this study to the field of urban e-commerce solutions in developing
African cities.
2.1 Overview of e-services and their role in improving access to essential goods
In this digital age, e-services have become integral to how societies function, offering unprecedented convenience and efficiency. E-services refer to the delivery and access of services of
information, or products via electronic/digital means, predominantly over the internet as seen
mentioned in Goundar (2021). These e-services encompass everything from online banking
and e-learning to digital government services, fundamentally changing how individuals and organizations interact with these sectors. At the forefront and the main concern of this thesis
is e-commerce, which involves the buying and selling of goods and services through online
platforms. E-commerce has revolutionized traditional retail by removing geographical barriers, reducing operational costs, and providing consumers with greater choice and accessibility.
Beyond e-commerce, there are several other key e-services that have transformed various industries. E-business enhances business processes through the use of ICT, streamlining production,
customer interactions, and internal management. E-learning, meanwhile, utilizes technology to
improve educational models, enabling remote learners to engage with course materials and each
6
Namibia University of Science and Technology
other. E-government leverages ICT to offer more accessible and efficient government services,
while e-health delivers healthcare services and information through online platforms, improving
access to medical care (Goundar, 2021). Together, these e-services demonstrate how digital
advancements continue to reshape and optimize traditional systems across sectors.
In the context of essential goods such as food, healthcare products, and household necessities, ecommerce platforms have the potential to significantly enhance access, especially in areas where
traditional retail infrastructure is lacking or inefficient. By leveraging digital technologies, ecommerce can bridge the gap between suppliers and consumers, offering solutions to logistical
challenges that have long hindered equitable access. However, in urban African contexts like
Windhoek, significant disparities exist between technological advancements and the everyday
realities faced by many residents. While some populations benefit from rapid modernization
and digital services, a substantial portion continues to struggle with inadequate access to essential goods due to infrastructural deficits and socio-economic challenges (Olaseni & Alade,
2012). This highlights the critical role that e-services and e-commerce could play in improving
accessibility within these settings, where socio-economic and infrastructural barriers persist.
Moreover, known as a highly sensitive topic with one of the most common buzz terms, one
still must not shy away from referencing the COVID-19 pandemic which has underscored
the critical importance of e-services in maintaining access to essential goods and services during times of crisis. The pandemic disrupted traditional supply chains and imposed restrictions
on movement, disproportionately affecting vulnerable and isolated individuals (Litman, 2021).
E-commerce platforms emerged as vital tools in ensuring that populations could continue to
obtain necessary items while adhering to public health measures. This situation highlighted
the necessity of effective communication from trusted authorities to alleviate confusion and
fear, particularly among those most at risk. It also emphasized the value of proactive community planning to prepare for and respond to the challenges of isolation, including implementing
policies and programs that strengthen essential service delivery, enhance community cohesion,
and improve the affordability and accessibility of resources for vulnerable populations (Litman,
2021). Furthermore, the pandemic brought to light the critical role of robust internet and
telecommunications networks in enabling remote work, access to information and services, and
maintaining social connections during periods of restricted mobility. These experiences demonstrate that investing in e-commerce and related e-services is not only beneficial for addressing
current accessibility gaps but is also crucial for enhancing resilience against future crises.
In cities like Windhoek, essential commodities such as food, healthcare products, and household
necessities are often concentrated in affluent neighborhoods, leaving marginalized communities
underserved (Crush et al., 2018) (Crush et al., 2020). Transportation issues further exacerbate
this problem, as unreliable public transit and the high cost of private transportation hinder
mobility for disadvantaged populations (Crush et al., 2018). E-services, particularly e-commerce
platforms, offer a promising solution to bridge this accessibility gap by enabling residents in
underserved areas to procure essential items remotely, thus bypassing some of the logistical
hurdles inherent in traditional retail models. Examining how e-services have been utilized in
other African cities provides valuable insights into their potential application within Windhoek’s
unique socio-economic landscape.
Integrating delivery services with e-commerce platforms can significantly influence local economies
and businesses by offering enhanced consumer convenience, expanding market reach for enterprises, and creating new employment opportunities in logistics (Ltd, 2024). For small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), these platforms provide access to a wider customer base,
potentially boosting sales and fostering entrepreneurship (Azam & Ansari, 2024) (Ltd, 2024).
In Windhoek, introducing a delivery platform like Etomart could substantially impact the local
economy, making it crucial to ensure fair competition and inclusive growth while mitigating
7
Namibia University of Science and Technology
adverse effects on existing businesses (Ltd, 2024). Addressing these considerations is essential
to ensure such platforms contribute positively to the city’s socio-economic development.
2.2 Technological Readiness and Digital Literacy in Namibia
Understanding the technological readiness and digital literacy levels in Namibia is crucial for
assessing the feasibility of implementing an e-commerce platform like Etomart. Technological
readiness refers to the availability and quality of information and communication technologies
(ICT) as well as technological infrastructure, such as telecommunications networks, internet
connectivity, and access to digital devices that enable the effective operation of digital services.
This infrastructure encompasses both hardware and software components, including internet
service providers, mobile networks, data centers, and the widespread availability of smartphones
and computers as emphasized by Dias (2021). Digital literacy is a critical factor influencing
the ability of individuals to engage with e-services effectively. It encompasses not only basic
skills like operating digital devices and navigating the internet but also more advanced competencies such as understanding online security and participating in e-commerce transactions
(Communications Regulatory Authority of Namibia (CRAN), 2024).
E-commerce adoption in developing markets like Namibia presents both opportunities and challenges essential for implementing platforms such as Etomart, increasing internet penetration and
the proliferation of mobile devices provide a foundation for e-commerce growth, However, obstacles including limited digital literacy, inadequate technological infrastructure, and regulatory
hurdles often impede widespread adoption (Nosike, 2024). Economic inequalities and the prevalence of informal settlements with unreliable internet and digital payment systems exacerbate
these issues in Namibia as mentioned in Communications Regulatory Authority of Namibia
(CRAN) (2024). Economic inequalities and trust in online transactions also significantly influence adoption rates (Communications Regulatory Authority of Namibia (CRAN), 2024).
Learning from successful e-commerce implementations in similar markets can provide strategies
to overcome these barriers, aiding Etomart in navigating Windhoek’s specific challenges.
In Namibia, disparities in education, income, and access to technology contribute to varying
levels of digital literacy among the population. By addressing technological readiness and improving digital literacy, Etomart can enhance its feasibility and potential impact in Windhoek.
Collaborative efforts between the government, private sector, and community organizations may
be necessary to improve infrastructure, provide digital education, and create an enabling environment for e-commerce growth (Dias, 2021). Such partnerships could focus on initiatives like
expanding broadband access, offering community-based digital literacy programs, and developing user-friendly platforms tailored to the local context (Dias, 2021). These efforts would not
only support the adoption of Etomart but also contribute to the broader digital empowerment
of Windhoek’s residents.
Cultural attitudes toward technology and trust in online transactions also significantly influence
adoption rates. Skepticism about the security of online payments and concerns over privacy
can deter individuals from engaging with e-commerce platforms (Nosike, 2024). Building trust
through education and demonstrating the reliability and security of online transactions is essential (Communications Regulatory Authority of Namibia (CRAN), 2024) (Tiwana & Ramesh,
2001). Learning from successful e-commerce implementations in similar markets can provide
strategies to overcome these barriers. For instance, mobile money solutions have been effectively
utilized in other African countries to facilitate secure and accessible payment methods for those
without traditional banking services (Nosike, 2024). Adapting such solutions to the Namibian
context could aid Etomart in navigating Windhoek’s specific challenges. Potential strategies
include educational programs, community training initiatives, government-led digital inclusion
policies, and partnerships with private sector organizations to provide resources and support.

Ultimately, the successful implementation of Etomart hinges on a multifaceted approach that
considers the socio-economic realities of Windhoek. By proactively addressing potential negative
impacts on traditional businesses, enhancing technological infrastructure, and fostering digital
literacy, Etomart can position itself as a catalyst for positive change. This analysis can inform
recommendations for policy adjustments, infrastructure investments, and educational initiatives
that could enhance Windhoek’s readiness for platforms like Etomart.
2.3 Socio-economic Factors and Urban Infrastructure
Socioeconomic factors encompass a combination of social and economic characteristics related
to individuals or groups, such as their occupation, educational attainment, income level, and
residential area (Wilkerson et al., 2018). In our study, these factors contribute to socioeconomic
disparities, which are characterized by the uneven allocation of resources and opportunities arising from variations in income, education, employment, and living conditions. These disparities
can create systemic barriers that impede fair access to essential needs like food, healthcare,
and other vital services. Urban infrastructure encompasses the interconnected networks of
structures, systems, and facilities that are crucial for a city’s daily life and future growth as
emphasisized by Saidi et al. (2018). Urban infrastructure in the context of this study refers
to the fundamental physical and organizational structures, systems, and facilities that support
the functioning and development of a city. In this case, with a focus on systems and structures
based on:
• Transportation networks: Roads, public transit systems, pedestrian pathways, and
cycling routes that facilitate movement within the city.
• Utility systems: Water supply, sewage treatment, electricity distribution, and telecommunications networks.
• Digital infrastructure: Internet connectivity, smart city technologies, and digital platforms that support urban services.
The concentration of supermarkets and essential service providers in central or affluent areas
forces residents of informal settlements to travel long distances, often without reliable transportation options (Shinyemba, 2019). Examining these infrastructural obstacles within Windhoek’s urban environment highlights how they contribute to the difficulties faced by disadvantaged populations in accessing essential goods.
Socio-economic factors and urban infrastructure critically influence access to essential goods
within any city, and in Windhoek, these elements are particularly impactful due to pronounced
disparities among different communities. Understanding how these socio-economic factors interplay with Windhoek’s urban infrastructure is essential for evaluating the feasibility of implementing solutions like Etomart. This study explores how these disparities affect access to
essential goods, examines the specific infrastructural challenges within Windhoek’s urban layout, and considers innovative approaches to urban logistics that could alleviate these issues.
Socio-economic disparities and their impact on access to essential goods are evident in Windhoek’s diverse regions and populations. These disparities manifest as significant differences in
income levels, employment opportunities, educational attainment, and healthcare access among
the city’s residents (Sunde, 2024). Marginalized communities, particularly those in informal
settlements, often experience high unemployment rates, limited access to quality education,
and inadequate living conditions and such factors contribute to reduced purchasing power and
limit individuals’ ability to obtain essential goods (Sunde, 2024). The impact of these disparities extends beyond economic limitations, influencing social mobility and the overall well-being
of affected populations (Sunde, 2024). Analyzing the nature of socio-economic disparities in
9
Namibia University of Science and Technology
Windhoek reveals how these inequalities directly hinder access to essential goods for vulnerable
groups.
Innovative solutions for urban logistics in developing African cities have emerged to address
the challenges posed by socio-economic disparities and infrastructural limitations. In many
such cities, creative strategies have been implemented to improve the distribution of essential
goods to undeserved communities (Habiyaremye et al., 2022). These innovations often leverage
technology, community participation, and alternative delivery models to overcome logistical
barriers fostering inclusiveness and strengthening African innovation systems (Adesida et al.,
2021). These approaches can be taken for consideration, assessing their implementation using
identical criteria to foster innovation that can curb the aforementioned socio-economic and urban
infrastructural challenges, Examples include mobile marketplaces, micro-distribution centers,
crowd-sourced delivery services, and the use of digital platforms to connect consumers with
local vendors. Exploring successful urban logistics solutions in similar contexts can provide
valuable insights into their potential applicability to Windhoek. By analyzing these models, we
can identify strategies that could enhance the effectiveness of platforms like Etomart in bridging
the accessibility gap and promoting inclusive economic growth.
2.4 Feasibility of an E-Commerce Platform
Assessing the feasibility of introducing an e-commerce platform in Windhoek involves a multifaceted analysis of the city’s socio-economic landscape, technological readiness, and infrastructural capabilities. For instance, Uganda has developed a National E-commerce Strategy aiming
to establish a fully-fledged e-commerce economy by 2025, with objectives to boost trade, create jobs, and promote innovation in the e-commerce ecosystem (Ministry of ICT and National
Guidance, 2021). This strategy includes empowering businesses through e-commerce, improving
ICT infrastructure, and incentivizing the formalization of informal businesses (Ministry of ICT
and National Guidance, 2021). These approaches highlight the importance of comprehensive
planning and supportive policies in the successful implementation of e-commerce platformm and
by exploring these aspects, we aim to determine whether Etomart can serve as a viable solution
to the challenges faced by Windhoek’s residents in accessing essential goods and services.
As discussed by Mthembo and Dlodlo (2017) argue that that Namibian SMEs can benefit
greatly from adopting e-commerce but face challenges in doing so. E-commerce presents an
opportunity for SMEs to expand their market reach and reduce operational costs, However,
e-commerce adoption among Namibian SMEs is low, with few retailers offering online shopping
and a limited online share turnover. The adoption of e-commerce depends greatly on the
company’s technological infrastructure which can be measured by assessing the companies ereadiness. E-readiness refers to a company’s ability to successfully adopt e-commerce technology
infrastructure.
Etomart presents an innovative approach to overcoming the barriers that hinder access to essential goods in Windhoek, particularly for marginalized communities. However, the challenges
faced by major e-commerce players in Africa, such as Jumia, Takealot, and Kilimall, indicate
that profitability can be elusive due to logistical constraints, limited payment gateways, security concerns, customer trust deficits, high data costs, and competition from brick-and-mortar
retailers (Gopaldas, 2023). Understanding these challenges is crucial for Etomart to develop
strategies that address issues like improving logistics, offering secure and accessible payment options, and building customer trust. By leveraging e-commerce technologies and efficient delivery
systems, Etomart can connect consumers directly with suppliers, reducing the dependency on
physical retail outlets that are often inaccessible to many residents. Etomart could enhance
accessibility by offering a wide range of products through an online platform, providing convenient and cost-effective delivery options, and tailoring services to meet the specific needs of
10
Namibia University of Science and Technology
underserved populations. It also considers the potential socio-economic benefits, such as job
creation in the digital and logistics sectors, and the empowerment of local businesses through
increased market reach.
Despite these challenges, the e-commerce sector in Africa is experiencing explosive growth,
driven by increasing internet and smartphone usage, improved logistics and payment solutions,
and a burgeoning youth population (African Leadership Magazine, 2023). Initiatives like the
African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) aim to create a unified digital market across
the continent, further enhancing the potential for e-commerce platforms like Etomart (African
Leadership Magazine, 2023). By capitalizing on these trends and learning from the experiences
of other e-commerce ventures in Africa, Etomart can position itself to contribute significantly
to Windhoek’s economic development.
Therefore successful implementation of Etomart in Windhoek is contingent upon a variety of
factors that must be thoroughly evaluated. Key considerations include the existing technological
infrastructure and its capacity to support widespread e-commerce activities, the level of digital
literacy among potential users, and the cultural attitudes towards online shopping, trust in
digital payment systems, and the competitive dynamics of the local market are critical factors
that could influence user adoption and sustainability of the platform.
To assess Etomart’s viability, a structured feasibility study using both qualitative and quantitative research methods is proposed. This study will conduct market analysis to gauge demand and
consumer readiness, evaluate technological infrastructure, and project financial sustainability.
Data will be collected through surveys, interviews with residents, local businesses, and by examining case studies and existing research of similar e-commerce implementations. A risk analysis
will identify potential obstacles and mitigation strategies. This comprehensive approach aims
to provide actionable insights and recommendations for developing and implementing Etomart
in Windhoek.
3 Problem Statement
Despite Windhoek’s economic growth and modernization, a significant portion of its residents
continue to face profound challenges in accessing essential goods and services. The stark socioeconomic disparities, particularly evident in the northern areas and informal settlements, have
created an environment where essential goods are not readily available to all. The uneven distribution of retail outlets forces residents to travel long distances, often on foot or via unreliable
transportation, just to obtain essential items (Shinyemba, 2019). This lack of accessibility is
more than an inconvenience, it is a daily hardship that exacerbates feelings of marginalization
and neglect among the city’s most vulnerable populations. Families struggle to secure food,
healthcare products, and other necessities, impacting their overall well-being and perpetuating the cycle of poverty (National Planning Commission, 2023). The elderly, the unemployed,
and marginalized groups are particularly affected, as they often lack the means or ability to
overcome these barriers.
African cities have begun to harness e-commerce and innovative delivery models to bridge similar
gaps. For example, online shopping platforms like Jumia in Nigeria, Takealot in South Africa,
and Kilimall in Kenya have significantly improved access to goods and services, despite facing
challenges related to profitability and operational constraints as seen in Gopaldas (2023).These
platforms have leveraged increasing internet and smartphone penetration, as well as improved
logistics and payment solutions, to reach a wider customer base (African Leadership Magazine,
2023). However, they have also encountered obstacles such as logistical constraints, customer
trust deficits, and competition from traditional retailers (Gopaldas, 2023). Understanding these
challenges is essential for developing a feasible e-commerce solution in Windhoek that can avoid
11
Namibia University of Science and Technology
similar pitfalls and successfully meet the needs of its residents.
while Windhoek has yet to fully explore these opportunities. The limited adoption of ecommerce solutions in Namibia, hindered by technological infrastructure challenges and varying
levels of digital literacy (Communications Regulatory Authority of Namibia (CRAN), 2024),
means that many residents remain disconnected from potential avenues of relief.
There is an urgent need to address these disparities. Exploring the feasibility of an e-commerce
platform like Etomart, which offers hope for empowering these communities. By leveraging
technology to provide more equitable access to essential goods, we can begin to alleviate some
of the daily struggles faced by Windhoek’s disadvantaged residents. This study seeks not only to
understand the practicalities of such an implementation but also to provide better opportunities
and long-awaited solutions for those who have felt inconvenienced and neglected due to the city’s
selective advancements.
In summary, the persistent accessibility gap for essential goods in Windhoek’s socio-economically
disadvantaged areas is a complex problem rooted in urban infrastructural, economic, and technological challenges. Thus addressing this issue is imperative for fostering inclusive growth and
improving the quality of life for all residents. There is a pressing need to explore innovative, approaches like the potential offered by Etomart to bridge this gap and promote a more equitable
Windhoek for its residents.
To address these challenges and explore the potential of e-commerce in bridging the accessibility
gap in Windhoek, this study will focus on the following key research questions:
• How do socio-economic disparities and urban infrastructure in Windhoek impact residents’
access to essential goods, particularly in underserved areas?
• What is the current state of technological readiness and digital literacy in Windhoek, and
how do these factors influence the potential adoption of an e-commerce platform?
• How can an e-commerce platform like Etomart be designed to effectively address the
unique challenges of Windhoek’s socio-economic context?
• What are the potential economic and social impacts of implementing an e-commerce platform for essential goods in Windhoek, particularly on local businesses and marginalized
communities?
• What strategies can be employed to ensure the long-term sustainability and scalability of
an e-commerce platform like Etomart in the Namibian context?
• How do cultural attitudes and trust factors influence the adoption of e-commerce solutions
in Windhoek, and what measures can be taken to address these concerns?

5 Research Methodology
This study adopts a mixed-methods approach (McKim, 2017), underpinned by the pragmatic
paradigm, aiming to pragmatically address the research questions by employing both quantitative and qualitative methods. The methodology is designed to provide a comprehensive
understanding of the feasibility of implementing Etomart in Windhoek, considering the complex interplay of technological, and socio-economical factors.
5.1 Research Paradigm
The pragmatic paradigm emphasizes the practical application of ideas to solve real-world
problems and is renowned for its flexibility. This makes it highly compatible with our research
13
Namibia University of Science and Technology
needs, as it supports a problem-oriented approach that accommodates mixed-methods research.
Such an adaptable methodology fosters a comprehensive understanding of the key issues involved
(Hall, 2013), enabling the research to employ the most effective tools to achieve the objectives
(Kaushik & Walsh, 2019). This paradigm aligns seamlessly with the study’s aim of finding
actionable solutions to the accessibility challenges in Windhoek.
5.2 Research Design
A convergent parallel mixed-methods design will be employed, where qualitative and
quantitative data are collected and analyzed simultaneously but independently, and then merged
during interpretation. This design facilitates a comprehensive analysis by combining the strengths
of both methods (Creswell, 2013).
5.2.1 Data Collection Methods
Quantitative Data Collection and Analysis:
• Surveys: Structured questionnaires will be distributed to a representative sample of
Windhoek residents, targeting various demographics, including those in underserved areas.
The surveys will assess:
– Current accessibility challenges to essential goods.
– Levels of e-commerce adoption and familiarity.
– Digital literacy levels and access to technology (e.g., smartphones, internet).
– Willingness to use an e-commerce platform like Etomart.
• Analysis of Existing Data: Secondary data from governmental and non-governmental
organizations will be analyzed to understand economic indicators, demographic distributions, and market potentials. Statistical analysis will include descriptive statistics and
inferential techniques to identify trends and correlations.
Qualitative Data Collection and Analysis:
• Semi-Structured Interviews: In-depth interviews will be conducted with key stakeholders, including:
– Local businesses (e.g., small retailers, market vendors).
– Potential users from disadvantaged communities.
– Policymakers and representatives from relevant government departments.
These interviews aim to gather nuanced insights into the needs, challenges, and perceptions
related to accessing essential goods and adopting e-commerce solutions.
• Focus Groups: Facilitated discussions with groups of potential users will explore user
preferences, cultural attitudes, and potential barriers to adoption. This method encourages interactive dialogue, revealing collective viewpoints and concerns.
• Data Analysis: Qualitative data will be analyzed using thematic analysis to identify
recurring themes, patterns, and insights. Coding will be done systematically to ensure
reliability and validity (Braun2006).

\section{INTRODUCTION}

In an age defined by instant access to knowledge, services, and resources, where technology has redefined how we meet our needs, it is striking that many residents of Windhoek still face significant challenges in accessing essential goods. This reality highlights a critical gap that calls for innovative solutions.

Bridging the Accessibility Gap of Essential Goods in Windhoek is a feasibility study centered on Etomart, an innovative delivery platform designed to tackle the diverse challenges surrounding access to essential goods and services in Namibia's capital, affecting various communities and residents. Windhoek grapples with significant socio-economic disparities, as evidenced by Namibia's projected Gini coefficient of 0.58 for 2024, indicating a high level of income inequality \parencite{SIN2024}, particularly as the population is projected to more than double by 2050, leading to heightened demands for essentials (e.g., water, goods, services and other essential needs) of which are set to intensify . 


This demographic shift, which is already significantly impacting Windhoek's resource demands, underscores the urgent need for innovative solutions as seen in \textcite{WNCOEMSFQACWS2018} and as the capital city experiences rapid urbanization and economic growth, it faces significant challenges in its supply chain, particularly in underserved informal settlements where residents struggle to access basic necessities like food, household items and other basic needs due to socio-economic disparities. This geographical split  contribute to the ingrained disparities in the basic living conditions and opportunities.

Windhoek's layout tells a glaring story of this socioeconomic divide. The non-northern parts of Windhoek's areas stand in sharp contrast to its northern sector. This geographical split isn't just about location; it represents a deep-rooted disparity in living conditions and opportunities. While residents in the central and surrounding areas enjoy better access to services and amenities, those in the northern areas often face significant challenges in their daily lives. This divide shows a clear separation, highlighting the uneven distribution of resources and development across the city. The contrast between these areas serves as a constant reminder of the economic inequalities that persist in Windhoek, therefore, underscoring the need for solutions that can bridge this gap and foster inclusive growth.
